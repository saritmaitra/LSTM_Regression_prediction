# LSTM_Regression_prediction

Prediction of stock price is quite a challenging because of highly volatile nature of time series combined with stochastic movement with non-linear . Here, the problem we have in hand is a price prediction issue and we’re trying to predict a numerical value defined in a range (from 9000 to 12500 approx). This problem fits the Regression Analysis framework. We shall be using neural network architecture to try to solve the problem here.

We’ll be demontrating how Deep Neural Network can be used for forecasting and use it to predict future price. Let us load the hourly frequency data.
